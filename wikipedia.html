                Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (; born May 14, 1984) is an American
                businessman. He co-founded the social media service Facebook and its parent company Meta Platforms
                (formerly Facebook, Inc.), of which he is chairman, chief executive officer and controlling shareholder.
                Zuckerberg has been the subject of multiple lawsuits regarding the creation and ownership of the website
                as well as issues of user privacy.

                Zuckerberg briefly attended Harvard University, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his
                roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. Zuckerberg took the
                company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2008, at age 23, he became the world's youngest
                self-made billionaire. He has since used his funds to organize multiple donations, including the
                establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. His net worth as of June 13, 2024, is US$176 billion,
                making him the fourth richest person in the world, behind Elon Musk, Bernard Arnault, and Jeff
                Bezos.<br><br>

                Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York to psychiatrist Karen (née
                Kempner) and dentist Edward Zuckerberg. He and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were
                raised in a Reform Jewish household in Dobbs Ferry, New York.[5] His great-grandparents were
                emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland. Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before
                transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy. He was captain of the fencing team.<br><br>

                Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. In high school, he built a
                program that allowed all the computers between his house and his father's dental office to communicate
                with each other.[9][10] During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called
                the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which
                was posted to Slashdot[11] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[12] The New Yorker once
                said of Zuckerberg: "some kids played computer games. Mark created them".[5] While still in high school,
                he attended Mercy College taking a graduate computer course on Thursday evenings.[5]<br><br>
                <b><ins>College life</ins></b><br>
                The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already
                achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy".[5] He studied psychology and computer science,[13]
                resided in Kirkland House,[14] and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi.[5] In his second year, he wrote a
                program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the
                choices of other students and help them form study groups.[15] Later, he created a different program he
                initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie

                In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.[19] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg
                launched "Thefacebook", originally located at thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates Eduardo
                Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[20][21] An earlier inspiration for
                Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in
                2002. It published its own student directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as
                "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many
                private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their
                friends, and their telephone numbers<br><br>

                A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created
                by Wayne Chang and focusing on peer-to-peer file sharing, was launched. At the time, both i2hub and
                Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August
                2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file
                sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications, which was launched in
                2007.
                In 2013, Zuckerberg launched Internet.org, which he described as an initiative to provide Internet
                access to the five billion people without it as of the launch date. The project faced significant
                opposition in India, where activists said its limited internet ran counter to the principle of net
                neutrality; Zuckerberg responded by saying that a limited internet was better than no internet.
                Internet.org was shut down in India in February 2016, although Zuckerberg later met with Indian Prime
                Minister Narendra Modi to discuss further possibilities.<br><br>

                <b><ins>Connect u lawsuit</ins></b><br><br>
                Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of
                intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com
                (later called ConnectU).[22] They filed a lawsuit in 2004; it was dismissed on a technicality on March
                28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in a federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards
                to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between
                ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million
                common shares and pay $20 million in cash.[71]

                In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of 02138, a magazine that
                catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's Social Security number, his parents' home address,
                and his girlfriend's address. Though Facebook filed to have the documents removed, the judge ruled in
                favor of 02138.[72]
